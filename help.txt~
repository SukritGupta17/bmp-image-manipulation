Usage: bmpedit [OPTIONS...] [input.bmp]

DESCRIPTION:
	This program does simple edits of BMP image files. When the program runs it first prints
	out the width and height of the input image within the BMP file. Once this is done if
	there is a filter(or sequence of filters) then they are applied to the image. The 
	resulting image is also stored using BMP format into a output file. Without any filters
	the width and height of the image is outputed.

OPTIONS:
	-o FILE		Sets the output file for modified images (default output file is "out.bmp")

	-t 0.0-1.0	Apply a threshold filter to the image with a threshold: the value given.

	-b 0.0-1.0	Blend two images together; image 1 blends on top of image 2 depending on 
			the blend value provided.
			-Usage: bmpedit -b 0.0-1.0 image1.bmp image2.bmp

	-b		if no blend value provided the images are blended evenly.
			-Usage: bmpedit -b image1.bmp image2.bmp
			(Output image produced will be "blendOut.bmp)"

	-bsh		Used to change the Brightness, Saturation and Hue values of an image.
			three values are passed after the flag ranging from 0-100, each corresponding
			to Brightness, saturation and hue respectively. if a 0 is passed no change is
			made to that part.
			-Usage: bmpedit -bsh <value for brightness> <value for saturation> <value for hue> -o output
			_file_name.bmp input_file_name
			If "-o" flag not used, default file "modified.bmp" is used.

	-g		Used to convert image to grayscale.
			-Usage bmpedit -g -o output_file_name.bmp input_file_name.bmp
			If "-o" flag not used, default file "greyscale.bmp" is used.

	-i		Used to invert the colors of the input image
			-Usage bmpedit -i -o output_file_name.bmp input_file_name.bmp
			If "-o" flag not used, default file "invert.bmp" is used.

	-cf		Used to apply color filter to input image. takes value 'r' for RED filter
			'g' for GREEN filter and 'b' for BLUE filter.
			-Usage bmpedit -cf <filter wanted> -o output_filename.bmp input_filename.bmp
			If "-o" flag not used, default file "colorFilter.bmp" is used.

	-h		Displays this usage message.
