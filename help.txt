Usage: bmpedit [OPTIONS...] [input.bmp]

DESCRIPTION:
	This program does simple edits of BMP image files. When the program runs it first prints
	out the width and height of the input image within the BMP file. Once this is done if
	there is a filter(or sequence of filters) then they are applied to the image. The 
	resulting image is also stored using BMP format into a output file. Without any filters
	the width and height of the image is outputed.

OPTIONS:
	-o FILE		Sets the output file for modified images (default output file is "out.bmp")
	-t 0.0-1.0	Apply a threshold filter to the image with a threshold: the value given.
	-h		Displays this usage message.
